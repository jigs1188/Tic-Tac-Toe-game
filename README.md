# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm

## Description
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players, 'X' and 'O', compete against each other. The game incorporates the minimax algorithm to ensure optimal strategic decision-making by the AI player.

## Key Features
- Players: 'X' and 'O'
- Game Rules: Players take turns marking empty cells until one player wins by marking three cells in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- AI Strategy: Minimax algorithm used for the AI player's decision-making.

## Scenario
The game progresses as the AI player ('O') and the human player ('X') take turns marking cells. The AI player optimally selects its moves using the minimax algorithm. The game concludes when a player wins or the board is filled.

### Sample Gameplay Transcript
- Player O marks position 4.
- Player X marks position 7.
- Gameplay continues until one player wins.
- Maximum depth of exploration and the number of leaves evaluated are tracked per game.

## Project Outcome
The AI player ensures optimal gameplay by employing the minimax strategy. The analysis of the game tree depth and the number of evaluated leaf nodes provides valuable insights into computational complexity.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Algorithm: Minimax

## Impact
- Enhances understanding of game theory and AI implementation in board games.
- Demonstrates strategic decision-making algorithms in gaming environments.
